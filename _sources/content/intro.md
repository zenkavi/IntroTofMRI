# Intro To fMRI

These are some notes heavily borrowing from other openly available resources such as:

```
https://dartbrains.org/content/intro.html  
https://naturalistic-data.org/content/intro.html  
https://mriquestions.com/  
https://miykael.github.io/nipype_tutorial/  
https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/SDC-BIDS-sMRI/  
```

The difference of these notes is that they are organized slightly differently. Additionally, unlike Dartbrains, we won't rely on `nltools` but use `fsl` and `nipype` more directly to become more familiar with the data structures and the gold standards of tools.
